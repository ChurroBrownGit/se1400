            <h3>This website was created in 2025 as part of a Web Development project for my 11th grade class. While it started as a school assignment, it quickly turned into something more fun and personal. I wanted to build a site that not only helped me learn how to code, but also gave people something to smile about. And what better way to do that than with cats?</h3>
            <h3>Cats are basically the internet’s favorite animal. They’re funny, dramatic, lazy, chaotic, and completely adorable. Whether it’s a cat sleeping in a shoe, chasing invisible objects, or sitting in a perfectly-sized box, they have a way of making people laugh and feel better. That’s what this site is all about—celebrating those weird and wonderful cat moments.</h3>
            <h3>You’ll find a few different pages around the site:</h3>
            <h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contact Page – If you have questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi, you can find my email here. I’ll try to respond as soon as possible.</li> 
                    <li>Upload Page – Want to share your own cat photo? You can upload it here! All images are moderated before being added to the site to keep everything safe and positive.</li> 
                    <li>Gallery Page – This is the main hub for cat photos. Browse through images submitted by others, or check back to see if your own photo made it in!</li> 
                    <li>Cat of the Week (COTW) – Each week, one featured cat is chosen and users can vote. It’s just for fun, but we treat it like serious business.</li> 
                    <li>Home Page – Get a quick overview of the site and see a few highlighted images with captions to help you get started.</li> 
                </ul>
            </h3>
            <h3>This website is a mix of code, creativity, and community. I built it to learn something new and to create something that makes people happy, even for just a moment. Whether you're just here to browse or want to take part, I hope you enjoy it.</h3>
            <h3>Thanks for visiting, and don’t forget to give your cat a high-five from me.</h3>
            <h2>You're awesome!</h2>
